*   You can move the Jan data folder to a specific folder by following the steps [here](/docs/settings#access-the-jan-data-folder).
*   Please see the [Jan Data Folder](/docs/data-folder) for more details about the data folder structure.

## GPU Acceleration[](#gpu-acceleration)

Once Jan is installed and you have a GPU, you can use your GPU to accelerate the model's performance.

### NVIDIA GPU[](#nvidia-gpu)

To enable the use of your NVIDIA GPU in the Jan app, follow the steps below:

1.  Open Jan application.
2.  Go to **Settings** -> **Advanced Settings** -> **GPU Acceleration**.
3.  Enable and choose the NVIDIA GPU you want.
4.  A success notification saying **Successfully turned on GPU acceleration** will appear when GPU acceleration is activated.

While **Vulkan** can enable Nvidia GPU acceleration in the Jan app, **CUDA** is recommended for faster performance.

1.  Open Jan application.
2.  Go to **Settings** -> **Advanced Settings** -> enable the **Experimental Mode**.
3.  Enable the **Vulkan Support** under the **GPU Acceleration**.
4.  Enable the **GPU Acceleration** and choose the GPU you want to use.
5.  A success notification saying **Successfully turned on GPU acceleration** will appear when GPU acceleration is activated.

### Intel Arc GPU[](#intel-arc-gpu)

To enable the use of your Intel Arc GPU in the Jan app, you need to activate the Vulkan support first by following the steps below:

1.  Open Jan application.
2.  Go to **Settings** -> **Advanced Settings** -> enable the **Experimental Mode**.
3.  Enable the **Vulkan Support** under the **GPU Acceleration**.
4.  Enable the **GPU Acceleration** and choose the GPU you want to use.
5.  A success notification saying **Successfully turned on GPU acceleration** will appear when GPU acceleration is activated.
