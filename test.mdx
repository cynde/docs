# Nextra

**Nextra** is a framework on top of Next.js, that lets you build content focused websites. It has all the great features from Next.js, plus extra power to create Markdown-based content with ease.

## Quick Start[](#quick-start)

To start using Nextra, you need to select a theme first:

[![Documentation theme](https://nextra.site/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fdocs-theme.fbd25b85.png&w=3840&q=75)Documentation theme→](/docs/docs-theme/start)[![Blog theme](https://nextra.site/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fblog-theme.56ff2f82.png&w=3840&q=75)Blog theme→](/docs/blog-theme/start)

If you want to use Nextra without using these built-in themes, you can follow the [Custom Theme](/docs/custom-theme) docs.

## Nextra FAQ[](#nextra-faq)

The Nextra FAQ is a collection of useful questions and answers about the project. If you have a question that isn't answered here, please [open a discussion (opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/discussions).

**Can I use Nextra with Next.js app router?**

No, Nextra only works with the `/pages` directory at the moment. Support for the app router has not been implemented yet. But you can use `/app` and `/pages` at the same time - just put your docs inside `/pages` and your other routes in `/app`

**Can I use X with Nextra?**

The answer is “yes” for most things. Since Nextra is just a Next.js plugin, almost all the things that can be done with React can be done with Nextra. Here are some examples and guides:

*   [Use Tailwind CSS](/docs/guide/tailwind-css)
*   [Use custom CSS and Sass](/docs/guide/custom-css)
*   [Use custom fonts (opens in a new tab)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)

**How can I add a live coding component in Nextra?**

There are libraries like [Sandpack (opens in a new tab)](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io) and [react-live (opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) that can help you add live coding components to your MDX.
