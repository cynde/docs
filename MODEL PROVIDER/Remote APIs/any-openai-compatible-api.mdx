# Any OpenAI-compatible API

This guide outlines the process for configuring Jan as a client for both remote and local API servers, using the `mistral-ins-7b-q4` model for illustration. We'll show how to connect to Jan's API-hosting servers.

Currently, you can only connect to one OpenAI-compatible endpoint at a time.

### Step 1: Configure a Client Connection[](#step-1-configure-a-client-connection)

1.  Navigate to the **Jan app** > **Settings**.
2.  Select the **OpenAI**.

The **OpenAI** fields can be used for any OpenAI-compatible API.

3.  Insert the **API Key** and the **endpoint URL** into their respective fields. For example, if you're going to communicate to Jan's API server, you can configure it as follows:

`   "full_url": "https://<server-ip-address>:1337/v1/chat/completions"            `

Please note that currently, the code that supports any OpenAI-compatible endpoint only reads the `~/jan/settings/@janhq/inference-openai-extension/settings.json` file, which is OpenAI Inference Engines in the extensions page. Thus, it will not search any other files in this directory.

1.  Navigate to the **Hub** section.
2.  Select the model you want to use.
3.  Specify the model's parameters.
4.  Start the conversation with the model.

## Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting)

If you encounter any issues during the integration process or while using OpenAI with Jan, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

*   Double-check your API credentials to ensure they are correct.
*   Check for error messages or logs that may provide insight into the issue.
*   Reach out to their API support for assistance if needed.
