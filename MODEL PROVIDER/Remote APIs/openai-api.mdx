## How to Integrate OpenAI API with Jan[](#how-to-integrate-openai-api-with-jan)

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for integrating the OpenAI API with Jan, allowing users to utilize OpenAI's capabilities within Jan's conversational interface.

## Integration Steps[](#integration-steps)

### Step 1: Configure OpenAI API Key[](#step-1-configure-openai-api-key)

1.  Obtain OpenAI API Key from your [OpenAI Platform (opens in a new tab)](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) dashboard.
2.  Copy your OpenAI Key and the endpoint URL you want to use.
3.  Navigate to the **Jan app** > **Settings**.
4.  Select the **OpenAI**.

The **OpenAI** fields can be used for any OpenAI-compatible API.

5.  Insert the **API Key** and the **endpoint URL** into their respective fields.

You can also manually edit the JSON file in `~/jan/settings/@janhq/inference-openai-extension`.

### Step 2: Start Chatting with the Model[](#step-2-start-chatting-with-the-model)

1.  Navigate to the **Hub** section.
2.  Select the OpenAI model you want to use.

The OpenAI is the default extension for the Jan application. All the OpenAI models are automatically installed when you install the Jan application.

3.  Specify the model's parameters.
4.  Start the conversation with the OpenAI model.

### OpenAI Models[](#openai-models)

You can also use specific OpenAI models you cannot find in the **Hub** section by customizing the `model.json` file, which you can see in the `~/jan/models/`. Follow the steps in the [Manage Models](/docs/models/manage-models) to manually add a model.

*   You can find the list of available models in the [OpenAI Platform (opens in a new tab)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview).
*   The `id` property must match the model name in the list.
    *   For example, if you want to use the [GPT-4 Turbo (opens in a new tab)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo), you must set the `id` property to `gpt-4-1106-preview`.

## Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting)

If you encounter any issues during the integration process or while using OpenAI with Jan, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

*   Double-check your API credentials to ensure they are correct.
*   Check for error messages or logs that may provide insight into the issue.
*   Reach out to OpenAI API support for assistance if needed.
