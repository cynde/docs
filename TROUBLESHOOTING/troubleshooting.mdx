# Troubleshooting

## Broken Build[](#broken-build)

To resolve the issue where your Jan is stuck in a broken build after installation.

MacWindowsLinux

1.  Uninstall Jan.
    
2.  Delete Application Data, Cache, and User Data:
    

`   # Step 1: Delete the application data    ## Newer versions    rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/jan    ## Versions 0.2.0 and older    rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/jan-electron        # Step 2: Clear application cache    rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/jan*        # Step 3: Remove all user data    rm -rf ~/jan            `

3.  If you are using a version before `0.4.2`, you need to run the following commands:

``   ps aux | grep nitro    # Looks for processes like `nitro` and `nitro_arm_64`, and kill them one by one by process ID    kill -9 <PID>            ``

4.  Download the latest version of Jan from our [homepage (opens in a new tab)](https://jan.ai/).

Following these steps, you can cleanly uninstall and reinstall Jan, ensuring a smooth and error-free experience with the latest version.

Before reinstalling Jan, ensure it's completely removed from all shared spaces if installed on multiple user accounts on your device.
